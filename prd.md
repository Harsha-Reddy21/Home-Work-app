# AI-Powered Validation Function Generation & Meta-Validation System

## Overview

We are building an AI-powered educational platform that dynamically generates and evaluates validation functions for student responses to various activity types. These functions assess subjective answers based on logic, mathematics, or grid interactions. A critical part of the system is the **meta-validation engine**, which evaluates the correctness, reliability, and feedback quality of these generated functions in real time.

## Objectives

- Automatically generate validation functions using LLMs for dynamic student activities.
- Validate the correctness of these functions via meta-evaluation framework.
- Generate pedagogically appropriate feedback based on correctness and attempts.
- Continually improve reliability through systematic error detection and feedback loops.

## Core Features

### 1. Function Generation (LLM)
- Dynamically generate JavaScript validation logic.
- Few-shot prompt templates for various problem types.
- Custom instruction tuning for education domain validation patterns.

### 2. Meta-Validation Engine
- Execute test cases against generated functions.
- Compare with expected outcomes.
- Detect logical errors and classify error patterns.
- Quantitative metrics (accuracy, reliability score).
- Suggest function corrections and improvements.

### 3. Feedback Engine
- Context-aware, learning-aligned messages.
- Handles correct, incorrect, partially correct responses.
- Adjusts based on attempt history.
- Supports positive reinforcement and constructive guidance.

### 4. Template Library
- Reusable templates for common patterns: grid checks, number ranges, set logic, etc.
- Covers single-step and multi-step conditions.
- Includes safe defaults and edge case coverage.

### 5. Test Suite Generator
- Auto-create test cases from problem descriptions.
- Support for expected answer variants.
- Edge condition coverage.

### 6. Error Handling Framework
- Structured try/catch in generated code.
- Safe fallbacks and defaults.
- Alert system for high-confidence failures.

### 7. Adaptive Feedback Loop
- Update prompt templates based on past function failures.
- Score each function with confidence.
- Improve prompts and instructions based on error classification.

## Expected Deliverables

### For AI Engineers
1. **Improved RAG System**: Enhanced retrieval and pattern matching for similar validation scenarios.
2. **Template Library**: Standardized function templates for common validation patterns.
3. **Error Handling Framework**: Robust error handling patterns for edge cases.

5. **Validation Pipeline**: Automated quality assurance for generated functions.
6. **Adaptive Feedback Generator**:
   - Correct response templates with celebration and progression.
   - Incorrect templates with constructive guidance.
   - Partial correctness templates balancing encouragement and direction.
   - Attempt-aware messaging logic.
7. **Meta-Validation Framework**:
   - Test case generation from problem statements.
   - Systematic accuracy measurement against expected outputs.
   - Error pattern classification.
   - Confidence scoring.
   - Automated improvement suggestions.

## Research Questions

1. How can we improve few-shot learning for mathematical validation logic?
2. What are the optimal RAG strategies for code generation in educational contexts?
3. How can we ensure consistency in generated functions across activity types?
4. What testing frameworks are most efficient for generated function QA?
5. How to generate feedback that’s educational but not revealing?
6. What metrics best predict long-term reliability of a validation function?
7. Can meta-validation systems self-learn and improve over time?

## Dataset Info

- **Current Size**: 15 activity examples across education levels.
- **Distribution**: Grid (60%), Math (25%), Logic (15%).
- **Complexity Range**: Single condition → multi-step logic.
- **Issues**: Some records have missing worksheet levels or feedback examples.

## Tech Stack

- **LLM**: GPT-4o with instruction-tuned prompting.
- **Execution**: PyMiniRacer or external sandbox for JS function validation.
- **Frontend**: React (optional)
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Testing**: PyTest, JS Unit Runner
- **RAG Source**: FAISS / Weaviate over past validation examples

## User Flow

1. User creates a new activity.
2. LLM generates the JS validation function.
3. Meta-validation engine tests function correctness.
4. Feedback engine prepares messages for the student.
5. In case of failure:
   - Auto-suggests improvements.
   - Marks for manual QA if high-risk.
6. All results logged for training future models.

## Metrics

- Function accuracy (% of correct validations)
- Test coverage (pass/fail over N test cases)
- Error rate by activity type
- Confidence score distribution
- Feedback alignment score (rubric-based)
