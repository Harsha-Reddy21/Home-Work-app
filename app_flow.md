1. App Flow Overview
A. Content Authoring & Question Generation
Content Authoring

Educators or content creators define the curriculum structure (sections, lectures, worksheet_levels).
For each worksheet_level, they write a problem statement (prompt) describing the activity.
Question Generation

The system takes the prompt and validation criteria.
It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to provide the LLM with relevant examples and patterns.
The LLM generates:
The activity configuration (e.g., grid size, number range, etc.).
The JavaScript validation function (evaluate()).
The feedback function (feedbackFunction()).
The generated activity (prompt + logic) is stored in the database.




B. Student Experience
Activity Presentation

The app fetches the next activity for the student (based on worksheet_level).
The prompt and interactive UI (e.g., grid, input fields) are displayed.
Student Interaction

The student reads the prompt and interacts with the UI (e.g., taps cells, enters numbers, selects options).
The student submits their answer.
Answer Validation

The app passes the student’s answer to the LLM-generated evaluate() function.
The function returns whether the answer is correct or not.
Feedback

The feedbackFunction() is called to provide immediate feedback (audio/visual cues, hints, etc.).
Progression

The student moves to the next activity or retries the current one based on feedback and app logic.
The system records the attempt for analytics and progress tracking.

3. Key Points
Questions are generated by combining educator prompts with LLM-generated logic.
Students answer by interacting with dynamic UI elements tailored to each activity.
Validation and feedback are automated using the LLM-generated JavaScript functions.
